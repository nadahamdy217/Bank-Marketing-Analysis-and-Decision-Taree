# PRODIGY_DS_03

This project involved preprocessing a marketing campaign dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and treating outliers. It developed a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict client subscription to a term deposit, achieving an accuracy of around 90% on the test set. Feature scaling and log transformation were applied to improve model performance, with further evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. The project highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, model tuning, and thorough evaluation for successful machine learning outcomes.
